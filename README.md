# Alien exploration 2D game
This is my personal project of developing a 2D Game with basic Javascript, HTML and CSS.
Game has a lot of animation and is really fun and easy to play ( use arrows to move the player, tab to shoot enemies , 'd' to debug a game).
Generally, game has a lot of potential cause there is always an opportunity to develop animation.
Hope you enjoy my game.

P.S Litlle hint for playing :) Collide with small enemies to get double power up!
